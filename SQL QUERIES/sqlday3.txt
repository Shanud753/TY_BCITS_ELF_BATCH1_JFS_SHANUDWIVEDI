--->>SQL QUERIES TO SHOW TCL OPERATION<<-

**ROLLBACK**--Thier will be no removal operation from table because autocommit is true by default

1.ROLLBACK

 2.set autocommit=0;--to make autocommit false

3. insert into employee_info values (13,'dik',9019578621,'dik@gmail.com','2003-03-11','hr',90087,40,'2019-01-11','ab+','f',22);--PERFORMING DML OPERATION

4.   select * from employee_info;--seeing the updated table

5.rollback;--it will remove the last updated reord/row

6. select * from employee_info;--the last record would have been removed

****SAVEPOINT****

1. set autocommit=0;
2. savepoint test;--NAMES TO SAVEPOINT
3. update employee_info set name='leena' where eid=11;--PERFORMING DML OPERATION
4. savepoint test1;
5. insert into employee_info values (13,'rohan',9019578621,'roh@gmail.com','2001-11-01','software developer',97827,40,'2018-01-11','b+','m',33);
6. rollback to test;--both the dml operation have been rolled back


--->>SQL QUERIES TO SHOW SINGLE ROW SUBQUERY<<---
1. select * from employee_info where deptid=(select deptid from department where location='chennai');


-->>CROSS JOIN IN SQL YOG<<--

>>select * from employee_info cross join department  --->it matches all the records from both the tables (  employee_info,    department)

-->>INNER JOIN IN SQL YOG<<--
>>select * from employee_info inner join department on employee_info.deptid=department.deptid --->  IT MATCHES ONLY THE SAME RECORD WITH SAME COLOUMNAME

Q.WAQTD name,deptid,dname and deptid from employee and department table
>>select e.deptid,e.name,d.deptid,d.dname from employee_info e inner join department d on e.deptid=d.deptid   -->>to display names ,dname and deptid from 2 tables      


-->>NATURAL JOIN IN SQL YOG<<--                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 ->>select * from employee_info natural join department--It will match the record if any common field is their

-->LEFT OUTER JOIN<<--
-->>select * from employee_info e left outer join department d on e.deptid=d.deptid --matched the record from both the tables and all the records from left table
